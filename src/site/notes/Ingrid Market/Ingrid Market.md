# Welcome to my little ***Farmer’s Market***!!
(==Digital== Garden)

in this blog i am planning to write, not within a specific interval but just randomly really.. to update (and more journal) 
- [ ] what i have been up to, 
- [ ] my feelings/==relationships== in my life, 
- [ ] ==books== i have been reading, 
- [ ] ==movies== I have been watching, 
- [ ] ==plans== and just other random *serendipities*.
- [ ] and maybe hobbies like ==painting==, or ==piano==!!

I hope you enjoy :)

In the blogs I have made a few categories:
1. ==Fresh Produce==: My *OVER ALL* updates and really where I blog. This is my main form of documenting my time over periods and where I focus most my energy.
2. ==Handmade Crafts==: Sometimes I will want to make very specific blogs, this might be about food, watercolours, piano or any of my hobbies. These will be specific to the **ONE** thing I write about.
3. ==Coffee Beans and Music==: This is more for when I go to different Cafe’s, Restaurants, or Concerts.
