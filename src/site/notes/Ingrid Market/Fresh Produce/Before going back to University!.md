# What have I been up to?
This is my first [[Ingrid Market/Fresh Produce/Before going back to University!#About the Blog\|Blog]], so a lot of my spare time over the last 3 days have been dedicated to me creating this blog, as well as messing around with the settings and `css` of everything. I hope everybody likes the little market theme I have designed.
	(After watching ‘The French Dispatch’ with Bailey and Emeric, I was very tempted to change it into a newspaper theme but its okay!)
This has been good for me, as it has given me something *productive* to focus on; I would have felt quite bored over the holidays.

Although I tend to feel quite useless, especially when not working or spending time away on holidays: Reflecting on my time and my life has genuinely been quite helpful to make me feel more human.

Even though this was supposed to be a birthday gift back in 2023, and I didn’t get it until 2 days before I began University again; I have finally gotten myself a ==piano== for the apartment!!

#### About the ==Piano==
We had originally planned to keep the Piano next to the door where the A-frame typically is, although when moving it in we had realised it was slightly too long and hung in front of the entrance to my room!! 
Because of this, we instead placed it beside my bed which in the end, I think I much prefer anyways!!

It makes the view into my room (Accompanied by the lamps) very nice to look at, I am sure there is a word that fits the feeling I want to describe but I can’t seem to think of it at the moment.

The poster’s I like, but to this makes it feel more like a ==dorm== room than my home; which I *don’t* love.

I seem to have forgotten a big portion of Ryuichi’s song - ‘Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence’, as well as gotten slightly worse at the ‘Mia and Sebastians Theme’.
	This is okay to me, I have started learning Patrick Watson’s rendition of Perfect Days by Lou Reed, this song makes me feel a certain way!
#### About the ==Blog==
The Blog seems to me like a way to Journal, this is because I kind of find it hard to keep motivated!! I think that is okay and I will push past it.

I **HAVE** been focusing too much on the look of the website though! I spent maybe 2 hours getting the ==highlights== looking the way they do, and although I absolutely LOVE it, I am unsure whether it was worth staying up till 5AM to do!
	Next I would like to perfect the Sidebar, maybe JUST turn it into a Nav up the top of the page, although i’m unsure the **best** way to do this!
	I am also going to fix the `css` so maybe the images ‘hover’ in the middle instead of to the left (you aren’t going to be able to tell since you will only see the ‘after’ :))

Aside from these two, I have been trying to spend a bit of time with my family as they come to Melbourne; although both Maman and Dad are super busy they still manage to make time to see me!
	I took Maman (It was for her), accompanied by Emeric, Rose, and Noah, to a ‘mixed reality’ Ryuichi Sakamoto concert! I thought the music was ==INCREDIBLE== (Surprise haha), but the mixed reality almost felt dystopian! I am fairly certain Maman liked it though; she has brought up the music a few times since.

> There is. in reality. a virtual me. This virtual me will not age. and will continue to play the piano for years, decades, centuries. Will there be humans then? Will the squids that will conquer the earth after humanity listen to me? What will pianos be to them? What about music? Will there be empathy there? Empathy that spans hundreds of thousand of years. Ah, but the bateries won't last that long.
> - Ryuichi Sakamoto, 2023

The main song Maman keeps bringing up is ‘Aqua[^1]’, which genuinely sounds beautiful and I like even more than the one I play on piano!

I brought my friend Noah because to me (even if I struggle to pay for it), it is an essential in life.
	Culture, and art; really are the most ==***important***== things to me. Although intelligence (which is also incredibly important) can lead to easier conditions in life:
- through higher paying jobs
- or by helping you get through tougher situations (strategically).
	TRUE happiness must stem from art and culture, these are the things that directly influence feeling. Music, Movies, Dance, Paintings. Imagine yourself in an empty room; there is no option but to deteriorate emotion. I could be surrounded by misfortune; but as long as I have a welcoming environment, I am happy. It is horrible that within society we are punished and deprived of genuine happiness from a lack of financial ability.

#### Books
I made a little plan with Noah about reading books, since the holidays started I have read quite a few books,
- The Stranger
- No Longer Human
- Metamorphisis
- The Sound of Waves
- The Dream of the Red Chamber
And now I am nearly done ‘The Settings Sun’. by Osamu Dazai.
	I am in love with this book, although for some reason I do not keep picking it up, I would love to finish it but I just haven’t, and I have no reasoning or explanation.

I have also been going out drinking a lot with Noah, and Rose. A few O-Week party’s which were good, but I really feel a struggle to make new ‘==close==’ friends. It seems like I am likeable as many people come talk to me; but for some reason I dont seem to be making as many friends as the people around me.

This is hard to explain for me, and quite a struggle to write about, so I will keep it brief.
