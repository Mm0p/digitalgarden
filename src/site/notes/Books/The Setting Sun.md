#books
I have been thinking a lot about this book in recent times, and although it has been the better part of this month (march) since I have read it; I keep thinking about death.

Spoilers ==obviously==:

Let me summarise it to the best of my ability for anyone who hasn’t read it (and you really should).
keep in mind it has been roughly 3 weeks since I have read this.

---
This book follows a young girl named Kazuko, she has divorced her husband and moved back in with her mother. The war has just ended and they are carefully awaiting the return of her brother Naoji; who is declared missing.
After a little while and a bit of financial hardship, Kazuko and her widowed mother move to a new household with the help of a relative. They come from a aristocratic family after all.

The brother comes home, addicted to opium as he previously was and begins to treat both his sister and mother rather cruelly, in between trips to Tokyo (which last up to weeks).

At this point, the mother fall’s quite ill and the brother falls deep into addiction to drugs and alcohol. Kazuko is left to deal with this; but keeps a very optimistic and hopeful approach for the better part of the book. Eventually, the mother passes and later, as Kazuko has much less need to stay at home, chases after a man (who mentored Naoji for quite sometime). During her stay in Tokyo Naoji commits suicide, which she is confronted with upon her return.

### My thoughts
The two biggest things that stuck about this book, was the heavy theme of addiction and death.
Almost 3 weeks have past since I have finished this book, and it honestly feels like a scar; Osamu’s tragic life has held an impact on me I would had never expected.
##### The Mother
Throughout the story, we really grow together with Kazuko as she spends time with her mother, the hardest part about this book was seeing the similarities between Maman and Kazuko’s mum.

Her mum was full of hope, whenever something went wrong and Kazuko began to worry, her Mother would very quickly find reason’s to cheer up, she would bring hopefulness to dark situations but most importantly, she gave meaning to calm: when nothing was happening for Kazuko, she was able to find happiness and meaning through a bond, such as knitting, or caring for each other.

I can really see that in my Maman, the more time we spend together; the easier it is to do nothing.
I dont feel lazy, I dont feel like I need to be productive, I am just capable of admiring how far I’ve come.
Even with this aside, similarities arose from personality traits, like superstition.

I felt the ache Kazuko must had felt when her mother fell ill, and although at the time this was tough to read, nothing felt as bad as Naoji.

##### Naoji
Naoji’s suicide really came as a surprise, it was all very sudden and the end of the book was majorly dedicated to his suicide note.

Knowing Naoji (and being able to see) was based off Osamu’s life, made everything feel so much more real. Within the note Naoji explained how strong he thought his sister was, and why he waited until mother had passed but not until she had. 

> [!Naoji’s Journal]
> “Mama, scold me please!”
“What for?”
“They say I’m a weakling.”
“Do they? A weakling…. I don’t think I need scold you about that any more.”
Mama’s goodness is unsurpassed. Whenever I think of her, I want to cry. I will die by way of apology to Mama.
Please forgive me. Just this once, please forgive me.

Some of the content within the note is really tough to read.
He talks about every motive he had to end his life, he touches on the aristocracy, fear, anxiety, love, trouble with addiction.

The way this was written, it was not hard at all to empathise and really understand why these people felt the way they did, without actually being alive at the time to feel these things.

> [!Shadow]
> I ran riot and threw myself into wild diversions out of the simple desire to escape from my own shadow

He talks about the effort he put in to hide his true self away, just to be able to deal with the perceived version of him others saw, he put up a guard and in result lost himself, to the point where he could not deal without abusing drugs. All this while reiterating the words:

>Kazuko. 
>Please believe me.

It really is hard to think about, and to relate so much; it makes it even harder to read.

##### Other
This book has so much to offer, it touched on so many topics such as gender roles, abuse, love, and so many things I would had loved to cover; but no matter how hard I try; I cannot stop thinking about the harsh topic of death.
